# PROGRAM_CONCEPT
# a. If there are sufficient resources to make the drink selected, then the program should prompt the user to insert coins.
# b. Remember that quarters = $0.25, dimes = $0.10, nickles = $0.05, pennies = $0.01
# c. Calculate the monetary value of the coins inserted. E.g. 1 quarter, 2 dimes, 1 nickel, 2
# pennies = 0.25 + 0.1 x 2 + 0.05 + 0.01 x 2 = $0.52

# a. Check that the user has inserted enough money to purchase the drink they selected. E.g Latte cost $2.50, but they only inserted $0.52 then after counting the coins the program should say “Sorry that's not enough money. Money refunded.”.
# b. But if the user has inserted enough money, then the cost of the drink gets added to the machine as the profit and this will be reflected the next time “report” is triggered. E.g. Water: 100ml
# Milk: 50ml
# Coffee: 76g
# Money: $2.5
# c. If the user has inserted too much money, the machine should offer change. E.g. “Here is $2.45 dollars in change.” The change should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

# a. If the transaction is successful and there are enough resources to make the drink the user selected, then the ingredients to make the drink should be deducted from the coffee machine resources.
# E.g. report before purchasing latte:
# Water: 300ml
# Milk: 200ml
# Coffee: 100g
# Money: $0
# Report after purchasing latte:
# Water: 100ml
# Milk: 50ml
# Coffee: 76g
# Money: $2.5
# b. Once all resources have been deducted, tell the user “Here is your latte. Enjoy!”. If latte was their choice of drink.
